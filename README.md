# axios-mock

Example of mocking ajax data using axios.

You can use client-side mocks to:

* develop ahead of the back-end implementation
* develop without a DB or network connection
* force synthetic result sets

This is a pure-browser example. A tiny express webserver is provided to serve 
the files.

The javascript files in this demo use ES6 - no effort is made to transpile. Run
it in a modern browser.
